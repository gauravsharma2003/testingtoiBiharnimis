"raw_data": "Paragraphs: Nitish Kumar JD(U) Legislative Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in Bihar on 6 November and 11 November 2025 to elect the 243 members of the Bihar Legislative Assembly. The votes will be counted and the results will be declared on 14 November 2025. The tenure of Bihar Legislative Assembly is scheduled to end on 22 November 2025.[3] The previous assembly elections were held in October–November 2020. After the election, the National Democratic Alliance formed the state government, with Nitish Kumar becoming Chief Minister.[4] On 9 August 2022, JD(U) ended the alliance with BJP and Nitish Kumar resigned as Chief Minister.[5] On 10 August 2022, JD(U) joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance of RJD and Congress and Nitish Kumar took oath as the Chief Minister of the new government.[6] In January 2024, JD(U) ended the alliance with Mahagathbandhan and Nitish Kumar resigned as Chief Minister.[7] He formed the new government with BJP-led NDA and was sworn in as the Chief Minister again.[8] Election Commission of India announced the schedule for the Bihar Legislative Assembly election on 6 October 2025.[9] The 2025 Bihar Assembly election campaign centered on a mix of local and socio-economic issues. Unemployment and migration were prominent themes: parties noted that many Bihar youth migrate out of state for work, and competing manifestos promised large-scale job creation.[22] Caste politics also remained a key factor. All major parties pledged to support a new caste census and \"social justice\" measures, reflecting widespread calls to address the state's caste-based inequalities.[23] Corruption and governance were attacked by the opposition; for example, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav accused the Nitish Kumar government of \"institutionalising corruption\" and misusing government schemes (like a women's outreach programme) for electioneering.[24] The ruling alliance countered by criticizing the RJD's past (\"jungle raj\") and highlighting its own welfare record. A major flashpoint was the voter roll revision (Special Intensive Revision, SIR) carried out by the Election Commission. Opposition parties claimed the intensive revision was a partisan tool, alleging mass deletions of voters and promising protests or even an election boycott.[25] The NDA comprises BJP, JD(U), LJP(R), HAM(S), and smaller allies. JD(U) pushed for a 50:50 seat-sharing formula with the BJP. LJP(R) leader Chirag Paswan publicly backed Nitish Kumar as CM face.[33] The INDIA bloc includes RJD, Congress, Left parties, and VIP. Negotiations among allies were reportedly settled by mid-2025, with RJD taking the largest share. Jan Suraaj Party has announced that it will contest all 243 assembly constituencies independently.[34] All parties engaged in a mix of high-tech outreach and traditional campaigning. RJD's social media team went viral with AI-based videos mocking rivals, while BJP and JD(U) used WhatsApp groups and door-to-door campaigns, especially through women vistaraks.[citation needed] Congress focused on planned public rallies, while Jan Suraaj relied on grassroots mobilisation through panchayat visits and Prashant Kishor’s statewide padayatra.[35] The most prominent controversy surrounded the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of voter rolls. Opposition parties alleged disenfranchisement of minorities and migrants. The matter reached the Supreme Court and became a centerpiece of the INDIA bloc's protests.[36] An incident involving a portrait of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar at an RJD event triggered backlash. NDA leaders and the SC/ST Commission condemned it, demanding apologies. The RJD termed it political vendetta.[37] Prime Minister Modi held mega rallies in Motihari and Siwan, announcing infrastructure projects worth thousands of crores. Tejashwi Yadav addressed backward caste conventions and youth-focused meetings. Jan Suraaj's Gandhi Maidan rally in Patna drew significant crowds and launched the party's full-state tour. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi planned joint INDIA bloc rallies in August and September.[citation needed] On 24 June 2025, the Election Commission (EC) notified that it will conduct a Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls in Bihar before the elections. The exercise requires all the voters from the state to fill forms to be included in the voter list. People whose names were not in the 2003 voter lists need to provide additional documents. The notification also mentioned that the documents needed to be submitted within a month (with 25 July being the deadline). Further, the voters need to provide one of the eleven documents mandated by the EC, with the common documents such as the Aadhaar card, voter ID card and ration cards, not included as valid documents. A significant number of people in Bihar do not have any of the 11 documents. Furthermore, a significant population of the state migrate in other parts of India for work or study and it is estimated that at least 75 lakh (7.5 million) people from Bihar migrate to other parts of India.[38] Critics have argued it would be difficult for such voters to be a part of this exercise. Such factors have led to fears of mass exclusion of voters. Opposition parties – such as the INDIA alliance – alleged that such an exercise will favor the ruling NDA alliance. The Election Commission denied these allegations and claimed that the exercise is lawful and constitutional.[36][39][40][38] The SIR was challenged in the Supreme Court. On 10 July, the court advised the Election Commission to consider the Aadhaar card, voter ID card and ration cards as valid documents for the exercise.[41] On 21 July, the Election Commission responded by saying that it will not accept the Aadhaar card, voter ID card and ration cards as valid documents, as suggested by the Supreme Court.[42] In August, Tejashwi Yadav, leader of the opposition, Bihar, alleged his name was removed from the voter list after the SIR exercise. The Election commission dismissed the allegations as factually incorrect[43] and declared the EPIC number shown by him to the media was fake. The poll body asked him to submit the fake voter ID card to the ECI office by 16 August 2025.[44] In August 2025, Rahul Gandhi made allegations against BJP about election commission.[45][46] The ECI dismissed the allegations as misleading,[47][48] and asked him to submit the allegations under oath or apologise to the nation.[49] Main Text: Toggle the table of contents 2025 Bihar Legislative Assembly election 5 languages বাংলাहिन्दीਪੰਜਾਬੀதமிழ்తెలుగు Edit links ArticleTalk English ReadEditView history Tools Tools move to sidebar hide Actions ReadEditView history General What links hereRelated changesUpload filePermanent linkPage informationCite this pageGet shortened URLDownload QR code Print/export Download as PDFPrintable version In other projects Wikidata item Appearance move to sidebar hide From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Elections for the 18th Legislative assembly of Bihar 2025 2025 Bihar Legislative Assembly election ← 2020 6 November 2025 (2025-11-06) – 11 November 2025 (2025-11-11) 2030 → ← outgoing membersAll 243 seats in the Bihar Legislative Assembly122 seats needed for a majorityOpinion pollsRegistered74,355,976 (3.5%)[1] Leader Dilip Jaiswal Tejashwi Yadav Nitish Kumar Party BJP RJD JD(U) Alliance NDA MGB NDA Leader since 2024 2017 2005 Leader's seat MLC Raghopur MLC Last election 19.46%, 74 seats 23.11%, 75 seats 15.39%, 43 seats Current seats 84[2] 76 48 Seats needed 38 46 74 Leader Rajesh Ram Mahbub Alam Chirag Paswan Party INC CPI(ML)L LJP (R) Alliance MGB MGB NDA Leader since 2025 1998 2021 Leader's seat Kutumba — — Last election 9.48%, 19 seats 3.16%, 12 seats New Current seats 17 12 — Seats needed 105 110 122 Bihar Legislative Assembly seats Incumbent Chief Minister Nitish Kumar JD(U) Legislative Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in Bihar on 6 November and 11 November 2025 to elect the 243 members of the Bihar Legislative Assembly.

Unemployment and migration were prominent themes: parties noted that many Bihar youth migrate out of state for work, and competing manifestos promised large-scale job creation.[22] Caste politics also remained a key factor. All major parties pledged to support a new caste census and \"social justice\" measures, reflecting widespread calls to address the state's caste-based inequalities.[23] Corruption and governance were attacked by the opposition; for example, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav accused the Nitish Kumar government of \"institutionalising corruption\" and misusing government schemes (like a women's outreach programme) for electioneering.[24] The ruling alliance countered by criticizing the RJD's past (\"jungle raj\") and highlighting its own welfare record. A major flashpoint was the voter roll revision (Special Intensive Revision, SIR) carried out by the Election Commission. Opposition parties claimed the intensive revision was a partisan tool, alleging mass deletions of voters and promising protests or even an election boycott.[25] Party campaign strategies[edit] NDA (BJP, JD(U), LJP(R),RLM,HAM(S)): The ruling coalition ran on a platform of development and social welfare. It emphasized caste-based outreach and welfare delivery, and frequently invoked Prime Minister Modi's leadership. The BJP also attacked the RJD over law and order and historic scams, while JD(U) emphasized Nitish Kumar's governance. Seat-sharing talks between BJP and JD(U) indicated a near-equal division.[26] RJD (leading INDIA bloc): The RJD centered its campaign on employment, youth issues, and anti-incumbency. Tejashwi Yadav pledged massive job creation and ran a digital-heavy campaign, including AI-generated videos and memes. The RJD organized backward caste meetings and positioned itself as the party of Dalits, OBCs, and the poor.[27] Jan Suraaj Party: Led by Prashant Kishor, Jan Suraaj positioned itself as an alternative to both NDA and the INDIA bloc. Kishor organized the Bihar Badlav Yatra, pledged to contest all 243 seats, and focused on governance, education, and clean politics. Between October 2022 and October 2024, he undertook padayatra across Bihar, walking over 5,000 km and visiting more than 5,500 villages to engage with local communities directly.[28][29] At the party's launch, Kishor announced provisions such as candidate selection through US-style primaries, the right to recall legislators who fail to perform, and a pledge that 90% of candidates would be first-time contestants.[30][31] Congress: As a partner in the INDIA bloc, the Congress highlighted youth migration and unemployment, notably through leader Kanhaiya Kumar's padyatra. Rahul Gandhi planned a multi-day campaign tour of Bihar in August 2025, criticizing voter list issues and advocating electoral reforms.[32] Alliances and seat-sharing[edit] The NDA comprises BJP, JD(U), LJP(R), HAM(S), and smaller allies. JD(U) pushed for a 50:50 seat-sharing formula with the BJP. LJP(R) leader Chirag Paswan publicly backed Nitish Kumar as CM face.[33] The INDIA bloc includes RJD, Congress, Left parties, and VIP. Negotiations among allies were reportedly settled by mid-2025, with RJD taking the largest share. Jan Suraaj Party has announced that it will contest all 243 assembly constituencies independently.[34] Digital and ground-level campaigning[edit] All parties engaged in a mix of high-tech outreach and traditional campaigning. RJD's social media team went viral with AI-based videos mocking rivals, while BJP and JD(U) used WhatsApp groups and door-to-door campaigns, especially through women vistaraks.[citation needed] Congress focused on planned public rallies, while Jan Suraaj relied on grassroots mobilisation through panchayat visits and Prashant Kishor’s statewide padayatra.[35] Campaign controversies[edit] The most prominent controversy surrounded the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of voter rolls. Opposition parties alleged disenfranchisement of minorities and migrants. The matter reached the Supreme Court and became a centerpiece of the INDIA bloc's protests.[36] An incident involving a portrait of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar at an RJD event triggered backlash. NDA leaders and the SC/ST Commission condemned it, demanding apologies. The RJD termed it political vendetta.[37] Major rallies and events[edit] Prime Minister Modi held mega rallies in Motihari and Siwan, announcing infrastructure projects worth thousands of crores. Tejashwi Yadav addressed backward caste conventions and youth-focused meetings. Jan Suraaj's Gandhi Maidan rally in Patna drew significant crowds and launched the party's full-state tour. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi planned joint INDIA bloc rallies in August and September.[citation needed] Controversies[edit] Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls[edit] See also: Association for Democratic Reforms v. Election Commission of India On 24 June 2025, the Election Commission (EC) notified that it will conduct a Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls in Bihar before the elections. The exercise requires all the voters from the state to fill forms to be included in the voter list. People whose names were not in the 2003 voter lists need to provide additional documents. The notification also mentioned that the documents needed to be submitted within a month (with 25 July being the deadline).

Such factors have led to fears of mass exclusion of voters. Opposition parties – such as the INDIA alliance – alleged that such an exercise will favor the ruling NDA alliance. The Election Commission denied these allegations and claimed that the exercise is lawful and constitutional.[36][39][40][38] The SIR was challenged in the Supreme Court. On 10 July, the court advised the Election Commission to consider the Aadhaar card, voter ID card and ration cards as valid documents for the exercise.[41] On 21 July, the Election Commission responded by saying that it will not accept the Aadhaar card, voter ID card and ration cards as valid documents, as suggested by the Supreme Court.[42] In August, Tejashwi Yadav, leader of the opposition, Bihar, alleged his name was removed from the voter list after the SIR exercise. The Election commission dismissed the allegations as factually incorrect[43] and declared the EPIC number shown by him to the media was fake. The poll body asked him to submit the fake voter ID card to the ECI office by 16 August 2025.[44] In August 2025, Rahul Gandhi made allegations against BJP about election commission.[45][46] The ECI

Prashant Kishor, who began his election campaign by claiming to deliver an \"Amethi-like defeat\" to Tejashwi Yadav, was initially scheduled to contest from Raghopur. Instead, the party sprung a surprise on Tuesday when it nominated Chanchal Singh for the constituency. The announcement was made by party’s national president, Uday Singh, who also handed over the party’s election symbol to Chanchal Singh. The Raghopur seat is in the limelight for another major reason: it is RJD chief Tejashwi Yadav’s bastion. And, Kishor was expected to give Tejashwi a tight fight with the political strategist-turned-politician, even boasting that he could unseat Tejashwi. Naturally, Kishor’s move to opt out of the fray has triggered speculations about what his ‘strategy’ is. Many suspect that Kishor’s decision had something to do with Tejashwi. While many cite the possibility of a secret pact, others claim the presence of Tejashwi could have prompted Kishor to rethink his strategy. However, political experts also believe that Kishor has made a strategic move as he realises that he is just building the support base, and entering the fray himself would be a risky move without a strong organisation. Therefore, he has first focused on establishing the party as a strong alternative. Political analysts also believe that while Kishor’s decision to contest the elections after challenging Tejashwi might seem like a retreat, it could also be preparation for a long battle. He is aware that the victory in Bihar politics is not just about seats but about changing mindsets too.

According to the list, JD(U) has fielded cabinet minister Maheshwar Hazari from Kalyanpur, Ratnesh Sada from Sonbarsa, Anant singh from Mokama and Ajay Kushwaha from Meenapur. Bihar polls: JDU releases first list of 57 candidates; Kaushal Kishore to contest from Rajgir &mdash; Jduonline (@Jduonline) Bihar polls: It won’t be PK vs Tejashwi at Lalu’s fief of Raghopur In a dampener of sorts to a keenly anticipated direct battle between Prashant Kishor and Tejashwi Yadav in the upcoming Bihar assembly polls, the Jan Suraaj has decided to field a littleknown political activist from Raghopur, a bastion of Lalu Prasad’s family where the RJD’s chief ministerial face has been winning from since 2015.“Tejashwi will file his nomination Wednesday,” RJD spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav said. Pitted against Tejashwi will be Chanchal Singh of Jan Suraaj, the fledgling outfit founded by Kishor. On Tuesday, Jan Suraaj president Uday Singh handed the poll symbol to Singh.NDA is yet to announce its candidate from Raghopur.According to RJD sources, Tejashwi will leave for Raghopur early on Wednesday and submit his nomination papers at 11am. The party has urged its supporters to be in attendance in large numbers.The seat drew wide attention since Kishor had hinted at contesting from there. A few days ago, he even visited the Raghopur constituency, which is in Vaishali district.Raghopur votes in first of two-phase polls in Bihar on Nov 6. The last date for filing nomination papers is Oct 17. Bihar polls: Snubbed by ally BJP, Om Prakash Rajbhar's SBSP to contest solo BJP ally Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) Tuesday announced it would contest Bihar polls on its own. The announcement came hours after BJP sidelined SBSP to declare its seat-sharing arrangement with its Bihar allies — JDU, LJP (RV), RLM, and HAM.SBSP also released its list of 20 star campaigners, including party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar and his sons Arvind and Arun. Arvind, who is also the party’s national general secretary, will camp in Bihar and oversee the party’s poll work.SBSP national general secretary Shashi Bhushan Singh said the party is likely to announce its first list of candidates on Wednesday.SBSP sources said OP Rajbhar was seeking 10-12 seats from BJP. These were the seats where the party’s core vote base of Rajbhar, Bhar, and Rajvanshi communities have a sizable presence. Sources said Rajbhar has now narrowed down his demand to five seats — Rajpur (Buxar), Dhaka (East Champaran), Nalanda, Arwal and Sasaram (Rohtas).SBSP’s organisational strength in Bihar is marginal, but the party hopes to attract non-Yadav OBC and Rajbhar voters in eastern districts bordering UP.Known for flexing muscles while being a part of alliance in the past, Rajbhar wants to project himself as a key political player in the non-Yadav OBC matrix. A senior SBSP functionary said by going solo in Bihar, Rajbhar aims to project SBSP as a national OBC-centric party rather than just a regional ally of BJP, primarily in UP. Bihar polls: ECI orders probe into use of money power; steps up monitoring Bihar polls: JDU to release first list of candidates today \"The first list of JDU will be released today. The election campaign of CM Nitish Kumar will begin from tomorrow... We are fighting the election on the face of Nitish Kumar. On 14th November, Nitish Kumar will become the Chief Minister of Bihar... 50% women of Bihar are going to vote for Nitish Kumar. The result of the election will be unprecedented,\" said JDU MP Sanjay Kumar Jha. Bihar polls: 3 days left to file Phase-1 papers, opposition yet to finalise seat deal As suspense deepened over India bloc’s seat-sharing formula in Bihar, Congress’s central election committee met in Delhi Tuesday evening to finalise candidates for the Nov state polls. The meeting came amid signs that talks with key ally RJD have resumed after days of uncertainty.Congress election committee is learnt to have discussed 26 seats. Sources said the party has reviewed a total of 72 seats till now, but without a clear indication as to how many it will contest as part of the seat-sharing deal with the allies.Congress is likely to get up to 60 seats as its share in the alliance. At the CEC meeting, party president Mallikarjun Kharge is learnt to have told the panel that the screening committees should narrow down the search to a single candidate and then bring it before the CEC, expressing his dissatisfaction with the panel of names put before the committee headed by him.Adding intrigue to the INDIA uncertainty, RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha posted a cryptic couplet on social media — “Rahiman dhaga prem ka, mat todo chhitkay (Rahim says, do not break the thread of love)…” — while discussions between Congress and its ally gained pace. Opposition politicians are expected to announce the seat-sharing deal in Patna Wednesday, sources said.With just three days left before nominations close for the first phase, covering 121 of Bihar’s 243 seats, the alliance — comprising RJD, Congress, Left parties, and Vikassheel Insaan Party — is under pressure to finalise the seat allocations.A senior Congress functionary said the atmosphere had improved. “Relations have got sweeter again and the number is not an issue now. Well, there remain some hitches over the exchange of seats, which will be settled in due course,” he added.Sources said Congress has been offered two options — contest around 60 seats, or take 73 seats if Mukesh Sahani’s VIP is accommodated from its share. Monday’s talks between Congress managers and RJD functionary Tejashwi Yadav reportedly paved the way for Tuesday’s CEC meeting, suggesting a formula might already be agreed upon, pending formal announcement. The evening saw further developments. CPI-ML, a key Left ally, withdrew its list of candidates, signalling progress in negotiations. RJD allegedly reclaimed poll symbols issued to aspirants earlier. “We are not aware of it,” said RJD state spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav. “None could put pressure on RJD. We work with ideological commitments which can’t be changed. An alliance means mutual harmony. When everyone’s opinions are respected, it is an alliance.”Amid speculation, an RJD MP close to party patriarch Lalu Prasad’s family was seen near the CM House past midnight Monday, further fuelling chatter of behindthe-scenes talks. Members of India bloc have largely avoided public comments, choosing to stay ambiguous about the ongoing negotiations.This prolonged uncertainty marks a rare delay in Bihar’s political playbook — the first time in nearly three decades that seat-sharing talks among allies have stretched so close to the nomination deadline, leaving both party cadres and voters guessing about how the opposition alliance will take shape at the EVMs. Bihar polls: Mokama don Anant Singh files paper Anant Singh, a strongman known for his antics, on Tuesday filed his nomination papers as JDU candidate from Mokama assembly seat, his pocket borough, even as the party has yet to officially announce its nominees for upcoming Bihar assembly polls.The seat, which he has won four times in the past, is currently represented by his wife Neelam Devi, who won from there in 2020. Addressing the media, Singh said, “This election is based on people’s blessings and trust and I will always remain dedicated to serving people.” Singh later held a 35km roadshow with thousands of vehicles following him. Bihar polls: RJD says BJP wants to finish all regional parties \"We are saying this since the beginning that BJP's intention is to finish all regional parties... Now, conflicts have started to emerge within BJP as well,\" said RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari in reaction to Kushwaha's remark. Earlier, Kushwaha said \"everything will be fine\" while he was heading for Delhi to meet Union home minister Amit Shah. His remark suggested that not all differences have been ironed out in the BJP-JD(U)-dominant NDA. Bihar polls: Not all well in NDA? Upendra Kushwaha heads to Delhi; to meet Amit Shah \"I am going to Delhi. Some pondering needs to be done on the decisions that are being made in the NDA. I am going to Delhi to hold talks on the same. I'm hopeful that everything will be fine,\" said Rashtriya Lok Morcha chief and Rajya Sabha MP Upendra Kushwaha. Union Minister Nityanand Rai said: \"Just like Upendra ji has said, everything is fine and everything will be fine soon.\" Bihar polls: The agony and pain of being Jitan Manjhi Former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi made a casual remark at a social event a couple of months ago that revealed his inner hurt: “Though I am now a member of the Union cabinet, people in Gaya continue to regard me as an ordinary MLA and come to me for petty works.” The words carried both pain and resignation, a sense that despite his long career, Manjhi remains unrecognised in his own land.Some in Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), or HAM (S), say he has only himself to blame. Ever approachable and always available, he visits Gaya frequently, attends countless gatherings and greets people without ceremony — qualities that, ironically, have led many to take him for granted.Observers say despite 45 years in public life — he was first elected MLA in 1980 — Manjhi remains the most underrated neta of Magadh, even though he has been the only politician from that region of Bihar to become CM so far. “He may be politically smart, but mannerisms and snobbery are not part of his persona,” said activist Brajnandan Pathak, a long-time aide. His simplicity, Pathak said, becomes a source of embarrassment.Now in his eighties, Manjhi’s journey is punctuated with instances of humiliation. In the 1980s, while serving as a minister in a Congress govt, he failed to save a relative, a district welfare officer, from corruption charges and jail. The then DM ignored Manjhi’s pleas. Ironically, that same officer later became chief secretary of Jharkhand, while the DM who had jailed Manjhi’s relative eventually faced prison himself in a bribery scandal.In 2005, Manjhi was dismissed as minister within hours of taking oath over a vigilance inquiry into an earlier tenure in the Rabri Devi govt. He returned to the cabinet only after the case was dropped. In 2013, Manjhi, part of the state cabinet, went to meet the then CM at Gaya Circuit House. But security personnel, citing “standing instructions,” barred him in full public view.For a man who rose from the margins to Bihar’s highest office, Jitan Ram Manjhi’s story remains a portrait of dignity amid indignities — a veteran leader whose humility often outshines his power. Bihar polls: PM Modi to interact with Bihar booth workers today under ‘Mera Booth Sabse Majboot’ campaign Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with the booth-level party workers of Bihar on Wednesday under the 'Mera Booth Sabse Majboot' campaign and will hear their suggestions ahead of the forthcoming Assembly elections.The 'Mera Booth Sabse Majboot' initiative is a long-running, interactive outreach campaign aiming to strengthen the party's connections with its workers and supporters at the local or booth levels.Earlier on Sunday, PM Modi wrote in a post on X, \"Our dedicated workers have geared up with full energy for the victory of BJP-NDA in Bihar.

Because he was unable to bargain with Congress, he did this.

Charges will be framed against them. This development provides the NDA with a political weapon ahead of the Bihar assembly elections. BJP and JD(U) leaders have sharply criticized the RJD family over alleged corruption. The RJD claims it is political vendetta. The issue of seat allocation among NDA parties has been resolved through amicable discussions: Chirag Paswan \"The discussion on which party will contest which seat is also in its final stages with positive talks. Under the leadership of Modi ji and Nitish ji, all NDA parties are fully prepared with unity. Bihar is ready. NDA government,\" said Paswan on X.

He will campaign for the NDA' &mdash; ANI (@ANI) Bihar polls: Lalu jumps gun amid bickering over seat sharing deal in INDIA bloc; distributes tickets to RJD leaders Despite the approaching nomination deadline for Bihar assembly elections, the Mahagathbandhan has not yet finalized its seat-sharing deal. RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav has begun distributing party tickets to favored candidates, including prominent leaders who switched parties. This move follows a similar pattern from the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where RJD also announced candidates before a formal agreement. JD(U) MLA Gopal Mandal sits on the ground outside CM Nitish Kumar's house over his demand to meet the CM to get an election ticket from Gopalpur Assembly constituency in the upcoming Bihar elections- Watch &mdash; ANI (@ANI) NDA partners tussle over who’ll contest which seat Allies BJP and JD(U) on Monday withheld details of constituency allocations for the NDA in Bihar, sparking murmurs of discontent over seat distribution. For the first time, CM Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) appears set to share an equal number of seats with its saffron partner. Talks involving BJP state chief Dilip Jaiswal, Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, ministers Nitin Nabin and Vijay Choudhary, and JD(U)’s Sanjay Kumar Jha reportedly failed to resolve a tussle over key constituencies. Meanwhile, Dinara MLA Jai Kumar Singh quit JD(U) after his seat was allotted to the Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM). Despite the tensions, the NDA officially described the seat-sharing arrangement as “amicable”. Political Parties to get advertisements pre-certified by Media Certification and Monitoring Committee (MCMC); Candidates to inform the Commission of their authentic social media accounts, says the Election Commission of India Unfazed by seat-sharing woes, Lalu starts giving away RJD tickets RJD president Lalu Prasad distributed party tickets to candidates personally, despite the INDIA bloc in Bihar yet to announce a formal seat-sharing plan. A rush of aspirants gathered at the bungalow of his wife, former CM Rabri Devi, receiving tickets and emerging with the party symbol.Notable recipients included Sunil Singh (Parbatta), who recently quit JD(U), and former MLA Narendra Kumar Singh (Matihani), reflecting Tejashwi Yadav’s strategy to woo Bhumihars. Several sitting RJD MLAs, including Bhai Virendra and Chandrashekhar Yadav, also received tickets.The move echoes last year’s Lok Sabha polls when Lalu distributed tickets ahead of alliance approvals. The RJD’s allies include Congress, three Left parties, VIP, and potentially Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren’s JMM and RLJP. Not a single appeal filed so far against Bihar rolls: Chief electoral officer Not a single appeal has been filed so far against the inclusion or exclusion of any person in Bihar's final electoral roll published on September 30, 2025, the state chief electoral officer shared in a social media update on Monday.\"No appeal was received as of 13.10.2025 by the district magistrates under Section 24(a) of Representation of the People Act, with regard to inclusion or deletion of any name by the electoral registration officer (ERO) during the course of special intensive revision (SIR), across Bihar's 243 assembly constituencies,\" Bihar CEO posted on his official X handle. Politics takes a poetic turn in Bihar; seat-sharing talks drag on in INDIA bloc Seat-sharing talks in Bihar’s RJD-led Mahagathbandhan continue, marked by a poetic exchange between RJD’s Manoj Jha and Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi reflecting tensions within the alliance. Congress may get a smaller share due to its weaker past performance, while VIP has been offered 18 seats, including 10 where RJD candidates will contest on the VIP symbol. RJD has already asked likely candidates to begin filing nominations, and the alliance hopes to finalise seat-sharing and announce a joint manifesto in the coming days. Opposition seat-sharing announcement expected soon Congress leader Manoj Kumar indicated that the INDIA bloc may announce its seat-sharing formula by Tuesday, after ensuring fairness and consensus among alliance partners. Congress says Mahagathbandhan talks ongoing Congress state in-charge Krishna Allavaru stated that discussions on seat sharing within the INDIA bloc are still underway, aiming to form a strong, united government in Bihar. NDA's seat sharing for Bihar polls The ruling NDA finalised its seat allocation, earlier this week, with BJP and JDU contesting 101 seats each, LJP (Ram Vilas) 29, HAM 6, and RLM 6, as confirmed by Bihar BJP in-charge Vinod Tawde.

Now, conflicts have started to emerge within BJP as well,\" said RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari in reaction to Kushwaha's remark. Earlier, Kushwaha said \"everything will be fine\" while he was heading for Delhi to meet Union home minister Amit Shah. His remark suggested that not all differences have been ironed out in the BJP-JD(U)-dominant NDA.08:13 (IST) Oct 15Bihar polls: Not all well in NDA? Upendra Kushwaha heads to Delhi; to meet Amit Shah\"I am going to Delhi. Some pondering needs to be done on the decisions that are being made in the NDA. I am going to Delhi to hold talks on the same. I'm hopeful that everything will be fine,\" said Rashtriya Lok Morcha chief and Rajya Sabha MP Upendra Kushwaha. Union Minister Nityanand Rai said: \"Just like Upendra ji has said, everything is fine and everything will be fine soon.\"08:12 (IST) Oct 15Bihar polls: The agony and pain of being Jitan ManjhiFormer Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi made a casual remark at a social event a couple of months ago that revealed his inner hurt: “Though I am now a member of the Union cabinet, people in Gaya continue to regard me as an ordinary MLA and come to me for petty works.” The words carried both pain and resignation, a sense that despite his long career, Manjhi remains unrecognised in his own land.Some in Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), or HAM (S), say he has only himself to blame. Ever approachable and always available, he visits Gaya frequently, attends countless gatherings and greets people without ceremony — qualities that, ironically, have led many to take him for granted.Observers say despite 45 years in public life — he was first elected MLA in 1980 — Manjhi remains the most underrated neta of Magadh, even though he has been the only politician from that region of Bihar to become CM so far. “He may be politically smart, but mannerisms and snobbery are not part of his persona,” said activist Brajnandan Pathak, a long-time aide. His simplicity, Pathak said, becomes a source of embarrassment.Now in his eighties, Manjhi’s journey is punctuated with instances of humiliation. In the 1980s, while serving as a minister in a Congress govt, he failed to save a relative, a district welfare officer, from corruption charges and jail. The then DM ignored Manjhi’s pleas. Ironically, that same officer later became chief secretary of Jharkhand, while the DM who had jailed Manjhi’s relative eventually faced prison himself in a bribery scandal.In 2005, Manjhi was dismissed as minister within hours of taking oath over a vigilance inquiry into an earlier tenure in the Rabri Devi govt. He returned to the cabinet only after the case was dropped. In 2013, Manjhi, part of the state cabinet, went to meet the then CM at Gaya Circuit House. But security personnel, citing “standing instructions,” barred him in full public view.For a man who rose from the margins to Bihar’s highest office, Jitan Ram Manjhi’s story remains a portrait of dignity amid indignities — a veteran leader whose humility often outshines his power.08:02 (IST) Oct 15Bihar polls: PM Modi to interact with Bihar booth workers today under ‘Mera Booth Sabse Majboot’ campaignPrime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with the booth-level party workers of Bihar on Wednesday under the 'Mera Booth Sabse Majboot' campaign and will hear their suggestions ahead of the forthcoming Assembly elections.The 'Mera Booth Sabse Majboot' initiative is a long-running, interactive outreach campaign aiming to strengthen the party's connections with its workers and supporters at the local or booth levels.Earlier on Sunday, PM Modi wrote in a post on X, \"Our dedicated workers have geared up with full energy for the victory of BJP-NDA in Bihar.

Kushwaha announced on X that he was cancelling a meeting of party leaders in Patna to depart for Delhi along with the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Nityanand Rai. He said, \"Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai and I must depart for Delhi to discuss matters with Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Therefore, the meeting scheduled for today with party colleagues at the camp office in Patna has been postponed immediately.\" Shah's invite came after Kushwaha expressed his dissapointment over two of the party's six seats being suddenly allocated to other allies within the NDA. The party had already, reluctantly and conditionally agreed to accept the six seats assigned to them to field their candidates in a seat sharing meeting with the top leaders of the BJP.

Since the comment was made, BJP leaders have rushed to hold talks with the RLM leader to persuade him. Late into Tuesday night, Bihar BJP in-charge Vinod Tawde, Deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, and Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai were all seen arriving at Kushwaha’s residence. Nothing seemed to come out of the meeting, however. While speaking to the media, Kushwaha just said , \"Ask the same questions you are asking me to Samrat Chaudhary and Nityanand Rai.\" Kushwaha also created a storm in political circles by saying, \"This time nothing is well in the NDA...\" He had then forbidden all party leaders from attending the nominations of NDA leaders and had called for an emergency meeting of the party leaders which has now been postponed. After reaching Delhi on Wednesday he said to ANI \"I had said this in Patna as well that there is some issue in the alliance (NDA) that has to be resolved. We have come here to meet the Home Minister and believe that everything will be resolved.\" The Kushwaha makes up around 4.21 per cent of Bihar's population and Upendra Kushwaha is a prominent leader that can pull votes from the caste group. The RLM had earlier been allied with the JDU in 2010 and then switched to contest with the BJP in 2015. In 2020, the party formed an alliance with the BSP called the Grand Democratic Secular Front which defeated the NDA in 13 seats. The NDA then joined hands with the party for the upcoming elections. However the party's dissatisfaction with the seat-sharing might end up being a blow to the BJP-led alliance. Main Text: Former member of the legislative council and Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLM) president, Upendra Kushwaha, left for Delhi today amidst the ongoing seat-sharing dispute within the NDA ahead of the Bihar elections. Kushwaha announced on X that he was cancelling a meeting of party leaders in Patna to depart for Delhi along with the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Nityanand Rai. He said, \"Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai and I must depart for Delhi to discuss matters with Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Therefore, the meeting scheduled for today with party colleagues at the camp office in Patna has been postponed immediately.\" Shah's invite came after Kushwaha expressed his dissapointment over two of the party's six seats being suddenly allocated to other allies within the NDA. The party had already, reluctantly and conditionally agreed to accept the six seats assigned to them to field their candidates in a seat sharing meeting with the top leaders of the BJP. The six seats included Sasaram, Madhubani, Dinara, Bajpatti, Mahua, and Ujiarpur. VIDEO | Bihar Elections 2025: RLM president Upendra Kushwaha (@UpendraKushRLM) reaches Delhi.

"raw_data": "Paragraphs: Updated - October 15, 2025 02:29 pm IST Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. File | Photo Credit: ANI Two days after the ruling National Democratic Alliance declared its seat-sharing arrangement, cracks have begun to show within the Janata Dal (United) party. On Tuesday (October 14, 2025), party MP Ajay Kumar Mandal offered to resign, alleging that party leadership had denied him access to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Meanwhile, senior BJP leaders including Samrat Choudhary, Nityanand Rai, Nitin Nabin and others met RLM Chief Upendra Kushwaha at his Patna residence on Tuesday night after reports of him being displeased with seat-sharing arrangement. After a closed-door meeting, Mr. Kushwaha expressed his disappointment and said,” This time nothing is well in NDA.” With just three days remaining to the deadline for filing nominations for the first phase of elections to the Bihar Assembly, the Mahagatbandhan is yet to declare division of seats among its allies. Amidst the confusion, each party is finalising its list of candidates and intense negotiations are on between the allies to swap seats. As Bihar gears up for the 2025 Assembly elections, Bhojpuri superstar Khesari Lal Yadav revealed that he has been trying to convince his wife to contest the election. Mr. Yadav said that if she does not agree, he will campaign actively to support Tejashwi Yadav. “I want my wife to contest the election, I have been trying to convince her for the last 4 days. If she agrees, we will file the nomination; otherwise, I will only campaign and try to make Bhaiya (Tejashwi Yadav) win,” he said. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav filed his nomination papers to contest Raghopur assembly constituency in Vaishali district. His father and party chief Lalu Prasad too was present on the occasion. A large number of party supporters and workers were present outside the district election office at Hajipur. Amid raging confusion among Bihar ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and Opposition mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) blocs over constituencies to contest the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is all geared up to kick-off his poll campaign from tomorrow, October 16, 2025 (Thursday), from Samastipur district. Read more: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar gears up for poll campaign amid confusion over seat allocation in upcoming Assembly elections. Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav, who is also Leader of Opposition in the Bihar Assembly, to file his nomination papers from Raghopur constituency in Vaishali district. He will file the nomination at the District headquarters later today. Mr. Yadav has left his home in Patna to file his nomination papers. The Party chief and his father, Lalu Prasad Yadav, too is likely to be present on the occasion. The ruling BJP in Odisha today nominated Jay Dholakia as its candidate for Nuapada Assembly bypoll, voting for which will be held along with the second phase of Bihar polls on November 11. Mr. Dholakia, son of former BJD MLA Rajendra Dholakia, joined the BJP on October 11. He is scheduled to file his nomination papers as a BJP candidate tomorrow, party sources said. Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi and other senior leaders of the saffron party will remain present when Dholakia files his papers. The party has also planned a massive rally at Nuapada before Dholakia files his papers, they said. The bypoll was necessitated following the demise of Rajendra Dholakia, a four-time MLA, on September 8. His son was initially tipped to be the BJD’s candidate. The BJP, whose candidate Abhinandan Panda finished third in the 2024 Assembly polls, this time aspires to win the seat by banking on the sympathy wave in favour of Dholakia. Opposition Congress has named Ghasiram Majhi as its candidate, who is set to file his nomination papers on October 19. The BJD is yet to announce the name of its candidate. Opposition RJD today took a dig at poll strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor over his decision not to contest the Bihar assembly elections, saying “he had accepted defeat for his Jan Suraaj Party even before going to the battlefield.” Earlier in the day, Jan Suraaj Party founder Mr. Kishor announced that he would not contest the polls, a decision, he claimed, was taken by the party in the larger interest. In an exclusive interview with PTI, Mr. Kishor had also said that a “tally of less than 150 seats” for his party would be considered a defeat. Reacting to his remarks, RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwary siad, “Kishor has realised that he and his party will face a humiliating defeat in the upcoming assembly polls. That is why he has announced that he will not contest. He has accepted defeat for the Jan Suraaj Party even before going to the battlefield.” Mr. Kishor must realise that politics is not as easy as providing consultancy to political parties, said Tiwary, adding, “Kishor’s tyre has been flattened.” Echoing a similar view, Bihar BJP spokesperson Niraj Kumar said, “Kishor’s bubble burst even before the elections. By announcing that he won’t contest, he has admitted defeat for himself and his party. They will face a humiliating defeat in the polls.” JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said Mr. Kishor’s decision was a “humiliation” for his party workers. Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, who is touring poll-bound Bihar today, asserted that the NDA would return to power in the state with an “overwhelming majority” under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Nitish Kumar. Ms. Gupta, who arrived here to participate in the filing of nomination papers of some of the BJP candidates, told reporters that people of Bihar have witnessed that the pace of development in the state has picked up in the NDA rule and will vote for the ruling alliance. “I can see that there is a spring of development in Bihar, and prosperity is overflowing everywhere. Certainly, the NDA would once again form the government with an overwhelming majority under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. I pay my respects to the land of Bihar,” she said. Several BJP candidates are expected to file their nomination papers for the upcoming assembly polls today. With the last minute hiccups in seat sharing formula finalisation between two contesting blocs ruling NDA and Opposition Mahagthbandhan (Grand Alliance) in poll-bound Bihar are yet to be over, some of the Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leaders who, earlier, were given party symbols to file nomination papers have been asked to return it after party leader Tejashwi Yadav returned back to Patna from Delhi late night on October 13. Stampede-like situation outside RJD supremo's wife's bungalow as party symbols distributed prematurely, causing upset and confusion. Curtains were virtually down on talk that Prashant Kishor may contest against Tejashwi Yadav, as the Jan Suraaj Party (JSP) on Tuesday declared its candidate from Raghopur, where the RJD leader is aiming for a hat-trick of victories. JSP national president Uday Singh handed the party symbol to Chanchal Singh for Raghopur, an assembly seat in Vaishali district. A photo of it was shared on social media. Jan Suraaj Party announces candidate for Raghopur, potentially impacting Tejashwi Yadav's election strategy in Bihar. Expressing dissatisfaction over the seat-sharing arrangement within the ruling NDA in Bihar ahead of the assembly polls, Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) chief and Rajya Sabha MP Upendra Kushwaha today said, “This time, nothing is well in NDA.” Mr. Kuswaha, who left for Delhi today to meet senior BJP leaders, told reporters at the airport that “Everything will be fine. With this hope and belief, we are going to Delhi.” According to party insiders, Mr. Kushwaha is not happy with the six seats allotted to his party. He is also not happy with the allocation of the Mahua seat to another NDA constituent, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), headed by Union Minister Chirag Paswan. Efforts to convince Mr. Kushwaha by senior BJP leaders in Patna failed to make any headway. Union Minister Nityanand Rai and other state BJP leaders met Kushwaha in Patna yesterday evening. The meeting continued till late at night, after which Mr. Kushwaha told reporters, “This time, nothing is well in NDA.” Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, the only woman to hold the post among the 14 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled States, will campaign for the Bihar Assembly election, and be present when Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sinha files his nomination papers, officials said on Tuesday (October 14, 2025). Ms. Gupta will reach Lakhisarai on Wednesday (October 15), where she will accompany Mr. Sinha as he files his nomination, and will address a public meeting at the KRK ground there, according to officials at the Delhi Chief Minister’s Office. Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, the only woman CM among BJP-ruled States, to campaign for Bihar Assembly election. Enforcement agencies have seized cash, drugs, liquor and freebies worth ₹33.97 crore from poll-bound Bihar as part of efforts to prevent inducement of voters by political parties. The state goes to polls in two phases on November 6 and 11. Votes will be counted on November 14. The Election Commission said on Wednesday that since polls were announced on October 6, a total seizure of ₹33.97 crore worth of cash, liquor, drugs and freebies has been made by different enforcement agencies. Expenditure observers have already been deployed to monitor the election expenses incurred by the candidates and have reached their respective constituencies on the day of the notificationa for the two phases were issued. Jan Suraaj Party founder Prashant Kishor on Wednesday asserted that if voted to power in Bihar, his party will crack down on “100 most corrupt politicians and bureaucrats”, and have their ill-gotten wealth confiscated within the first month. In an exclusive interview with PTI, Mr. Kishor also alleged that corruption was rampant under the NDA government, even though the BJP-led coalition did not have as bad a reputation as the RJD headed by Lalu Prasad. “We have promised to rid Bihar of land mafia, sand mining mafia, and all other types of mafia. To this end, we have made six promises, including the scrapping of the bogus (farzi) prohibition policy”, said Mr. Kishor. Within a month of forming the government, a law will be made to identify 100 most corrupt politicians and bureaucrats of the state, who, “I am sure, must be conducting pujas to ensure that we do not come to power”. Amid intense speculations that the NDA seat-sharing deal has left him infuriated, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday gave away JD(U) tickets, by-passing the party’s earlier practice of announcing the names of candidates at a press conference. On the other hand, the BJP, which has been put on the same pedestal as the JD(U) for the first time in an assembly election, announced its first list of 71 candidates. Springing surprises, it denied a ticket to Speaker Nand Kishore Yadav, a seven-term MLA, while fielding Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary in a direct election after over a decade. Health and Law Minister Mangal Pandey, a member of the legislative council, has also been fielded by the party for the assembly polls. With just three days remaining to the deadline for filing nominations for the first phase of elections to the Bihar Assembly, the Mahagatbandhan is yet to declare division of seats among its allies. Amidst the confusion, each party is finalising its list of candidates and intense negotiations are on between the allies to swap seats. The deadline for filing nominations for the 121 seats that go to the polls in the first phase is October 17. The second meeting of the Congress Election Committee (CEC) was held on Tuesday (October 14, 2025) evening. After a three-hour meeting, the CEC decided to set up a four-member committee, headed by Ajay Maken, which will decide on the candidates after the seat-sharing negotiations are over. The Congress is expected to contest around 58-60 seats but there are differences over five seats with the RJD. Mahagatbandhan allies in Bihar yet to finalize seat division as nomination deadline approaches, intense negotiations ongoing. Jan Suraaj Party founder Prashant Kishor on Wednesday donned the political strategist’s hat to predict a certain defeat for the ruling NDA in Bihar, citing the inability of the BJP-led coalition to finalise seats and candidates. In an exclusive interview with PTI, Mr. Kishor, who recently said the JD(U) would struggle to win even “25 seats” in the 243-strong assembly, claimed that the picture has only grown bleaker for the party headed by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. “The NDA is definitely on its way out and Nitish Kumar will not return as chief minister”, asserted Mr. Kishor, who has worked closely with the JD(U) supremo, both as a poll analyst and later, for a brief period, as a party colleague. “You do not need to be a psephologist to fathom what is in store for the JD(U). In the last assembly polls, Chirag Paswan staged a revolt just a few days ahead of the announcement of elections and fielded candidates, many of whom were inconsequential, against nominees of Mr. Kumar’s party, causing its tally to crash to 43”, recalled Mr. Kishor. Two days after the ruling National Democratic Alliance declared its seat-sharing arrangement, cracks have begun to show within the Janata Dal (United) party. On Tuesday (October 14, 2025), party MP Ajay Kumar Mandal offered to resign, alleging that party leadership had denied him access to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. In another incident, MLA Gopal Mandal, another party leader, staged a sit-in protest outside the Chief Minister’s residence, citing similar grievances. Besides, at least three party leaders filed nominations even before the JD(U) formally released its list of candidates. Internal turmoil within JD(U) as leaders protest seat-sharing decisions, with MPs offering to resign and MLAs staging sit-ins. Jan Suraaj Party founder Prashant Kishor on Wednesday announced that he will not contest the Bihar assembly polls, a decision, he claimed, was taken by the party for its greater good. In an exclusive interview with PTI, the former political strategist also said that a “tally of less than 150 seats” for Jan Suraaj will be considered a defeat. “If Jan Suraaj Party wins the Bihar polls, it will have a nationwide impact. The compass of national politics will point in a different direction,” Kishor asserted. The Bihar polls will be held in two phases, on November 6 and November 11, and the counting will take place on November 14. Jan Suraaj Party founder Prashant Kishor opts out of Bihar Assembly polls, aiming for nationwide impact with party's success. Amid speculation of a rift within NDA, RLM Chief Upendra Kushwaha gets a phone call from Union Home Minster Amit Shah to meet in Delhi. Mr. Kushwaha posted a message on his Facebook account and said, “Minister of State for Home Affairs, Nityanand Rai, and I must depart for Delhi to discuss matters with Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Therefore, the meeting scheduled for today with party colleagues at the camp office in Patna has been postponed immediately.” Ahead of the Bihar Assembly election, the Election Commission of India (EC) on Tuesday (October 14, 2025) directed political parties to get advertisements pre-certified and asked candidates to inform the poll body about their “authentic” social media accounts while filing nominations. The election will be held in two phases on November 6 and 11, followed by counting of votes on November 14. In a statement on Tuesday, the EC said it has issued orders on October 9, requiring every registered, and national and State political party, and every contesting candidate to apply to the Media Certification and Monitoring Committee (MCMC) for pre-certification of all political advertisements on electronic media, including social media, before publication. EC directs Bihar election candidates to pre-certify ads, share social media accounts, and report internet campaign expenses. In a significant boost to the party ahead of the Bihar Assembly election, folk and devotional singer Maithili Thakur on Tuesday (October 14, 2035) joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Patna. Bihar BJP president Dilip Jaiswal was present at the event. Ms. Thakur is likely to contest in the upcoming election from Alinagar in Darbhanga, sources said. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Jaiswal exuded confidence in a victory for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The voters had made up their minds to form an NDA government with a “thumping majority”, Mr. Jaiswal said. Taking a dig at the Opposition mahagathbandhan alliance, he said they were “disheartened and depressed”, and claimed that more than half a dozen of the ‘Grand Alliance’ MLAs would soon join the BJP. Folk singer Maithili Thakur joins BJP ahead of Bihar election, BJP releases first list of candidates. In the 2024 general elections, Bihar was one of the few States where a higher percentage of women voted compared to men, even though there were fewer women than men registered on the electoral rolls. The plausible explanation for this was that a high number of men had migrated from the State to other parts of the country and were unable to travel back to their respective constituencies. One of the ostensible reasons for the Election Commission of India to conduct its Special Intensive Revision exercise — done within 40 days between June 25 and August 1 — was to exclude voters who were not ordinarily resident in Bihar, including migrants working outside the State. Given that the turnout of men was lower than the turnout of women (by several percentage points in some seats) in the election, it was expected that the share of male electors would be pruned, leading to a higher gender ratio from the 907 female voters for every 1,000 male voters registered in the 2024 general elections. In the 2024 Bihar elections, a higher female voter turnout was expected due to male migration, but gender ratio decreased. The BJP’s Central Election Committee (CEC) released its first list of 71 candidates for the upcoming Bihar Assembly election on Tuesday (October 14, 2025), with more than half belonging to disadvantaged communities. Only nine are women. Two members of the Bihar Legislative Council — the State’s Upper House, whose members are elected indirectly — are now being fielded in the direct election for the Assembly, the Lower House. Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary, who last contested the Assembly election in 2010 from the Parbatta Assembly seat, is now being fielded from the Tarapur seat, and will file his nomination on October 16, while Health Minister Mangal Pandey will contest from the Siwan Assembly seat. Bihar BJP releases first list of 71 candidates for Assembly elections, prominent leaders replaced, elections on November 6 and 11. As Bihar prepares for phase one of Assembly polls on November 6, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has warned that bulk SMSes and audio messages during the 48-hour ‘silence period’ which starts before the conclusion of voting, is prohibited. In a note issued on October 9 outlining campaigning restrictions, the poll authority said, political advertisements on any election matter in TV, cable networks, radio, cinema halls, use of bulk SMS/voice messages, audio visual displays in any polling area during the period of 48 hours ending with the hour fixed for the conclusion of the poll for any election in the polling area is prohibited. Election Commission of India prohibits bulk SMSes and audio messages during silence period before Bihar Assembly polls. Last night, senior BJP leaders including Samrat Choudhary, Nityanand Rai, Nitin Nabin and others met RLM Chief Upendra Kushwaha at his Patna residence after they learnt that Mr. Kushwaha was displeased with the seat sharing arrangements. After a closed- door meeting, no one spoke to the media when they left. At 12:30 a.m., Mr. Kushwaha expressed his disappointment and said,” This time nothing is well in NDA.” Sources said that Mr. Kushwaha is reportedly angry over giving the Mahua Assembly seat to the LJP(R) led by Union Minister Chirag Paswan.

The plausible explanation for this was that a high number of men had migrated from the State to other parts of the country and were unable to travel back to their respective constituencies.One of the ostensible reasons for the Election Commission of India to conduct its Special Intensive Revision exercise — done within 40 days between June 25 and August 1 — was to exclude voters who were not ordinarily resident in Bihar, including migrants working outside the State. Given that the turnout of men was lower than the turnout of women (by several percentage points in some seats) in the election, it was expected that the share of male electors would be pruned, leading to a higher gender ratio from the 907 female voters for every 1,000 male voters registered in the 2024 general elections.Read the story hereThe unexplained drop in gender ratio following Bihar’s SIRIn the 2024 Bihar elections, a higher female voter turnout was expected due to male migration, but gender ratio decreased.October 15, 2025 08:10 BJP first list out, both Bihar Deputy CMs get callThe BJP’s Central Election Committee (CEC) released its first list of 71 candidates for the upcoming Bihar Assembly election on Tuesday (October 14, 2025), with more than half belonging to disadvantaged communities.

The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) leaders Saturday arrived at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda’s residence in Delhi for the core group meeting, where they are likely to discuss the list of candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections, news agency PTI reported. The first phase of the Bihar Assembly elections will take place on November 6, with the second phase of voting on November 11. More than 7.4 crore electors of the state will cast their votes. The counting of votes will take place on November 14. While the seat-sharing formula remains undecided, the Congress has finalised the names of 25 candidates, at the meeting of the party’s Central Election Committee (CEC) in Delhi on Wednesday. Sources said these 25 seats include those of five sitting MLAs, including Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan, who represents Kadwa, and state president Rajesh Ram, the Kutumba MLA. The CEC will then meet in a day or two to finalise the names. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress have been at odds with each other over projecting Tejashwi as the Opposition Mahagathbandhan alliance’s Chief Minister face. The Congress has cited its practice of not declaring a CM face as a reason, even as party insiders say their leaders fear that non-Yadav OBC votes will consolidate against the Opposition alliance if Tejashwi is named the CM candidate. The Tejashwi-led party’s counter is that since it is the largest constituent of the Grand Alliance, it will have the final say on who becomes CM if the Mahagathbandhan comes to power. The Congress’s central leaders have sidestepped questions about differences in the alliance’s top two parties on the CM question, saying it will be decided after the results are declared on November 14.

The Tejashwi-led party’s counter is that since it is the largest constituent of the Grand Alliance, it will have the final say on who becomes CM if the Mahagathbandhan comes to power. The Congress’s central leaders have sidestepped questions about differences in the alliance’s top two parties on the CM question, saying it will be decided after the results are declared on November 14.

With just one day left for filing of nominations to commence, the fledgling party floated by former political strategist Prashant Kishor claimed to have stolen a march over NDA and INDIA bloc, the two main competitors, both of which were still busy thrashing out a seat-sharing deal. Releasing a list of 51 candidates, one of them a transgender from a reserved constituency, the party's national president Uday Singh said \"the next list will be out in a day or two\" but did not reveal whether the party's feted founder will himself enter the fray. Kishor had said that if he contested, his seat would be either his birthplace of Kargahar, from where the party has given ticket to Bhojpuri singer Ritesh Pandey, or Raghopur, the pocketborough of Tejashwi Yadav, for which candidate was yet to be announced. Nonetheless, Singh added, cryptically, \"Kishor will hit the campaign trail from Raghopur on October 11. It will be known in the course of time whether he will himself be the candidate or not\". Yadav, who at the age of 35 aims at a hat-trick from the seat, in the past represented by his father and mother Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, announced at a press conference that if the INDIA bloc, which his party helms in Bihar, came to power, \"we will bring an Act, within 20 days, to ensure that within 20 months every household has a member with a government job\". Yadav pointed out that during his brief stint as the deputy chief minister, he was able to go half way through on the promise of 10 lakh jobs made in 2020, slamming his ex-boss Nitish Kumar for failure to deliver on employment generation. The announcement was hailed by ally Congress. Talking to PTI video, Congress legislative party leader Shakil Ahmed Khan said, \"It does not need to be seen as a promise made only by the RJD. Job creation is a crying need for Bihar and Tejashwi Yadav has shown sensitivity towards it\". However, Neeraj Kumar, MLC and spokesperson of the JD(U), headed by the chief minister, termed the promise as \"anti-constitutional\".TrendingHarjas SinghBSEB Bihar STET Admit cardIND vs WI LiveStudent Gangrape West BengalNEET PG ResultIPS Officer SuicideDiwali 2025Pak Afghanistan ClashHarjas SinghBSEB Bihar STET Admit cardIND vs WI LiveStudent Gangrape West BengalNEET PG ResultIPS Officer SuicideDiwali 2025Pak Afghanistan ClashHarjas SinghBSEB Bihar STET Admit cardIND vs WI LiveStudent Gangrape West BengalNEET PG ResultIPS Officer SuicideDiwali 2025Pak Afghanistan ClashTired of too many ads?go ad free nowTop Stories Right NowDurand fault line: Pak's Taliban gamble has backfired - why it struggles to cont...New chapter in bilateral ties?

Earlier, Gyanesh Kumar said that voting for Bihar's 243 assembly seats will be completed by November 22, when the term of the current assembly ends.

The Election Commission on Monday announced a two-phase polls in the state, with voting to be held on November 6 and 11 and counting scheduled on November 14.

When the government is formed and work begins, progress is made swiftly in various schemes and initiatives. The announcement of the elections is a welcome step. I am fully confident that the NDA government will be formed again\". Congress MP Ranjeet Ranjan expressed confidence that the Mahagathbandhan will win the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections, stating that the people of Bihar are \"intelligent\" and aware of the state's key issues. \"Last time, the Mahagathbandhan couldn't form a government with very marginal votes...We are addressing the main issues in Bihar: employment of youth, the education system, paper leak issues, MNREGA-related concerns, and the safety of women,\" she told ANI. The LJP led by Chirag Paswan will hold talks with the BJP only on assembly seats, sources said, adding the party will not demand an MLC or Rajya Sabha seat. LJP Ram Vilas leaders will meet with Dharmendra Pradhan today or tomorrow to discuss seat sharing, they said. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has released its first list of candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections. This list includes candidates for Begusarai, Kusheshwarsthan in Darbhanga, Saraiya in Saran, Kasba in Purnia, Beni Patti in Madhubani, Phulwari Sharif and Bankipur in Patna, Kishanganj Sadar, Parihar Assembly constituency in Sitamarhi, Gobindpur in Motihari district, and Buxar Sadar. Hours before the Election Commission announces the dates for the Bihar election, AIMIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi has made a high-voltage political remark, saying that every community in Bihar has its leader, but Muslims don't. The Election Commission of India (ECI) on September 30 published the final electoral roll for the Bihar Assembly elections. Follow these steps to access the final voter list: 1.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar inaugurated a section of the Patna Metro on Monday, hours ahead of the announcement of the assembly elections in the state. A 3.45-km-long elevated corridor, covering three stations -- Patliputra Bus Terminal, Zero Mile, and Bhoothnath, was opened as part of the \"priority corridor\". Kumar also laid the foundation stones for six underground metro stations, including Patna Junction, and a 9.35-km-long tunnel connecting them, as part of corridor 1. Male voters also experienced substantial deletions, although less than women. Madhubani led with the removal of 95,000 male voters (from 17.4 lakh to 16.4 lakh). Patna followed closely with a decrease of 90,000 (from 26.3 lakh to 25.4 lakh). Other districts with high deletions included Saran (86,000), Purvi Champaran (85,000), and Gopalganj (80,000). Gopalganj reported the highest deletion of women voters, with a drop of 15.1 per cent or 1.5 lakh - from 10.3 lakh in January to 8.3 lakh in the final rolls. Madhubani had the second-highest decline, losing 1.3 lakh women voters, while Purvi Champaran saw a decline of 6.7 per cent or 1.1 lakh voters, Saran and Bhagalpur each recorded significant losses of about 1 lakh women voters. Interestingly, all five districts border either a neighboring state or a country - Gopalganj and Saran with Uttar Pradesh, Madhubani and Purvi Champaran with Nepal, and Bhagalpur with Jharkhand. The Election Commission of India (ECI) released the final electoral roll for Bihar after completing the special intensive revision (SIR) exercise ahead of polls in the state. The ECI data shows a significant drop in the number of voters - the total electorate decreased by approximately 38 lakh from 7.8 crore on January 1, 2025 to 7.4 crore in the final rolls. The impact on women voters is especially notable. Male voters decreased by 3.8 per cent (15.5 lakh), while women voters faced a sharper decline of 6.1 per cent (22.7 lakh). The gender gap in deletions could have important political consequences since women voters are key to both major alliances in Bihar. Bihar BJP chief Dilip Jaiswal's demand for the verification of burqa-clad voters during the upcoming Bihar election has sparked a massive row, with the RJD accusing the BJP of resorting to the politics of \"hatred\" and BJP's ally JDU distancing itself from the statement. The verification of burqa-clad women at polling booths is among the several suggestions made by BJP chief Jaiswal during his meeting with Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar yesterday. \"Tallying of faces of voters, especially burqa-clad women, must be ensured with respective EPIC cards so that only genuine voters get to exercise their franchise,\" he told the media after the meeting. Representatives of all political parties are meeting the Chief Election Commissioner in Patna to offer inputs and suggestions regarding the upcoming election. Revision of voter lists is required before every election, and a review after the polls won't be in accordance with the law, Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said today, countering the Opposition's offensive on the Special Intensive Revision in poll-bound Bihar. The poll body chief, who was in Patna for a two-day visit to oversee preparations for the upcoming election, spoke to the media this afternoon before leaving for Delhi. Starting his address in Bhojpuri, Kumar said the Special Intensive Revision in Bihar led to the purification of the state's voter list after 22 years. \"We congratulate the voters of India. Thank you to everyone for the successful SIR process. I appeal to all the voters of Bihar to celebrate this festival of democracy with the same enthusiasm as you celebrate Chhath. Everyone should vote and ensure their participation,\" he said. The Election Commission concluded the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) and released the final electoral list on September 30 amid intense scrutiny and criticism by the Opposition. The data showed a significant drop in the number of voters - the total electorate decreased by approximately 38 lakh from 7.8 crore on January 1, 2025, to 7.42 crore in the final rolls. On the final list, 21.53 lakh names were added and 3.66 lakh were removed. It also showed that male voters decreased by 3.8 per cent (15.5 lakh), while women voters faced a sharper decline of 6.1 per cent (22.7 lakh). The electoral battle in Bihar will witness a direct contest between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the 'Mahagathbandhan' - led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). The NDA currently holds 131 seats - BJP 80, JD(U) 45, HAM(S) 4, and two independents. The Opposition has 111 seats - RJD 77, Congress 19, CPI(ML) 11, CPI(M) 2, and CPI 2. Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj will also make its debut, contesting all 243 seats in the state. Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar told reporters that the number of voters at each polling station has been capped at 1,200 and that the serial number font and candidate photos - which used to be in black and white - will now be in colour. The Election Commission is set to announce the schedule for the high-stakes Bihar Assembly elections at 4 pm today. Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar has said that voting for Bihar's 243 assembly seats will be completed by November 22, when the term of the current assembly ends. Many political parties have urged the poll body to hold the election immediately after the 'Chhath Puja' festival - which will be celebrated at the end of October - to ensure greater voter participation as a large number of people employed in other states return home for festivities.

Nityanand Rai and I met with the Home Minister to discuss this,” Kushwaha said. He added, “This matter has been discussed, and we now hope there will be no further difficulties.” Expressing confidence in the alliance’s readiness, he said, “The NDA government will definitely be formed in Bihar. All NDA constituents are prepared in every way.” When asked about the Mahua seat, Kushwaha responded that an official announcement would be made in a separate press conference. Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) chief Upendra Kushwaha is meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah amid seat-sharing rift within NDA. The meeting is currently underway and has been going on for 30 minutes. Nityanand Rai is also present. Kushwaha had set a condition for this meeting. Supporters of Ramsurat Rai created a ruckus at the BJP office after his name was dropped from the party’s candidate list. Angry protesters shouted slogans, demanding the party reconsider its decision. The Janata Dal (United) has released its first list of 57 candidates for the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections. The announcement includes candidates for all four seats claimed by Chirag Paswan, signaling the party's intent to contest those constituencies firmly. Among the key candidates announced: Ratnesh Sada from Sonbarsa Vidyasagar Nishad from Morwa Dhumal Singh from Ekma Kaushal Kishore from Rajgir The list also features several senior leaders and sitting MLAs: Vijay Kumar Choudhary, a minister in the state government, will contest from Sarai Ranjan Narendra Narayan Yadav from Alamnagar Niranjan Kumar Mehta from Bihariganj Ramesh Rishi Dev from Singheshwar Kavita Saha from Madhepura Gandeshwar Shah from Mahisi Atirek Kumar from Kusheshwarsthan (Input from Shashi) Since the announcement of the elections on October 6, 2025, enforcement agencies have seized a total of Rs 33.97 crore in cash and other incriminating items. These include drugs, cash, liquor, and materials intended for use as freebies. The individuals from whom the items were seized failed to provide satisfactory explanations regarding the source or intended destination of the goods. AIMIM (All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen) will hold a press conference at 11:30 AM to announce the seats it plans to contest in the upcoming Bihar elections. Party leader Akhtarul Iman is expected to brief the media on the details. With less than a month to go for the Bihar Assembly polls, the opposition Mahagathbandhan is yet to finalise a seat-sharing agreement for the high-stakes electoral battle. The standoff shows no signs of easing, with Congress now adamant about contesting over 60 seats while the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) remains firm on offering 58. According to sources, the Congress is reportedly preparing to field candidates for 65 seats, which exceeds the allocation offered by RJD, further deepening uncertainty within the opposition alliance. Read More Jan Suraaj Party founder Prashant Kishor announced he won't contest the Bihar assembly polls, saying the decision was made for the party's greater good. In an exclusive interview with PTI, the former political strategist said that a \"tally of less than 150 seats\" for Jan Suraaj will be considered a defeat. A Jan Suraaj victory, he claimed, would shift the direction of national politics. \"If Jan Suraaj Party wins the Bihar polls, it will have a nationwide impact,\" he said. Responding to reports of Upendra Kushwaha’s displeasure, JDU leader Sanjay Jha said, “Everything is fine.” On Nitish Kumar’s reported dissatisfaction, he dismissed the buzz, saying, “Some people are setting the narrative.” He questioned the speculation around Nitish Kumar’s recent political activity. “Some say Nitish Kumar has become active — when was he not active?” Jha asserted that the Chief Minister “is keeping an eye on everything,” and added confidently, “The results will answer those who are setting the narrative.” RJD leader Sanjay Jha confirmed that Nitish Kumar will attend candidate nominations tomorrow and begin campaigning soon after, including in the crucial Kosi region. JDU Working President Sanjay Jha on Tuesday dismissed ongoing speculation about Nitish Kumar’s political moves, calling it a deliberate attempt by rumor mongers to create confusion. \"Nitish Kumar is fully active, and the NDA is united with a clear focus on Bihar’s development,\" Jha said. He criticised the circulation of old videos and baseless talk of a possible return to the RJD, stating, “Nitish Kumar has repeatedly said this is not going to happen now — that’s why they are spreading rumors.” He asserted that the opposition is unsettled because they sense the public mood is clearly in favor of the NDA. \"They are directionless while we are moving ahead with unity. The NDA will win a bigger majority than in 2010,\" Jha claimed. Osama, son of late RJD strongman and former MP Shahabuddin, was officially handed the party symbol by Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav last night. He will contest from the Raghunathpur seat. JDU Working President Sanjay Jha, who is holding a presser currently, has confirmed that the party's first list of candidates will be announced this afternoon, with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar set to kick off the election campaign starting tomorrow. JDU leader Sanjay Jha will address the media at 9 am. Congress has formed a sub-committee to finalise pending candidates of Bihar, which will meet today at 9 am at Indira Bhawan. Apart from the screening committee, it includes Salman Khurshid, T S Singh Deo, and P L Punia. The NDA’s internal rift deepened today as RLJP leader Upendra Kushwaha rebelled over the Mahua seat from his quota being handed to Chirag Paswan. In protest, Kushwaha withheld the party symbol from all his candidates and has called an emergency meeting of his party. Despite night-long efforts by BJP leaders to mollify him, Kushwaha refused to relent. In parallel, the BJP announced its first list of 71 candidates, while the JDU quietly distributed symbols to more than 70 candidates without formally releasing a list. Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM also moved ahead, issuing symbols to their respective candidates. The NDA's seat-sharing negotiations in Bihar continue to face turbulence, with the JDU strongly objecting to the allocation of several seats from its quota to Chirag Paswan’s LJP (Ram Vilas). The JDU refused to part with Sonbarsa, Rajgir, Ekma, and Morwa, despite repeated appeals from the BJP. It even went ahead and gave symbols to its candidates in these seats, signaling a firm stance. In the give-and-take that followed, JDU relinquished only two seats, Tarapur, a sitting seat, and Teghra, while acquiring the BJP’s Kahalgaon in return. Meanwhile, Chirag Paswan’s demand for BJP’s strongholds like Danapur, Lalganj, Hisua, and Arwal was denied, with the BJP fielding its own candidates there. Instead, Chirag was given two BJP seats: Govindganj (a sitting seat) and Brahmapur (a contested one), leaving his party with fewer high-profile constituencies. Top Congress leaders on Tuesday discussed the names of probable candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections at a meeting of the party's Central Election Committee. Sources said the party discussed more than 50 candidates for Assembly seats on which the party is likely to contest the polls. The Congress is likely to get a lesser number of seats than the last time due to its dismal performance in the 2020 assembly polls, when it won 19 out of 70 seats it contested.

"raw_data": "Paragraphs: Elections in the state of Bihar, India are conducted in accordance with the Constitution of India. The Assembly of Bihar creates laws regarding the conduct of local body elections unilaterally while any changes by the state legislature to the conduct of state level elections need to be approved by the Parliament of India. Elections to the Lok Sabha, also termed as General Elections, are typically held every 5 years after the central government has completed its term. It may also be held before the completion of term if parliament is dissolved early. Similarly, elections to Legislative Assembly are conducted every five years. Last Lok Sabha election was held in 2019 and Legislative Assembly election was held in 2020. Elections to the Rajya Sabha are held at regular interval with one third of the members retiring in a staggered manner. Members of Legislative Assembly elect the state's representative to Rajya Sabha. The elections to the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly are conducted along similar lines with the major difference being size of constituencies. At present each Lok Sabha constituency consists of 6 Legislative Assembly constituency. Each constituency elects a single member to represent them via a First Past the Post System, where a candidate with plurality of total votes cast is elected. Currently the major parties in the state are Bharatiya Janata Party, Indian National Congress, Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Rashtriya Lok Morcha and Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party. The state was dominated by Indian National Congress until the decade of 1970s with parties like BJP and Janata Dal gaining prominence. For the purpose of elections every party is assigned a symbol to help voters in recognizing the candidate they support. Currently, the state of Bihar sends 40 representatives to the Lok Sabha, elected through a first past the post system. The Indian general election, 2009 in Bihar were held for 40 seats with the state going to polls in the first four phases of the general elections. The major contenders in the state were the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Indian National Congress and the Fourth Front. NDA consisted of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (United) whereas the fourth front was constituted of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Lok Jan Shakti Party (LJP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP). Both the houses of the state legislature jointly nominate Members of Parliament to the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha or Council of States is the upper house of the Parliament of India. Membership of Rajya Sabha is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of 250 members, and current laws have provision for 245 members. Most of the members of the House are indirectly elected by state and territorial legislatures using single transferable votes, while the President of India can appoint 12 members for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. Members sit for staggered six-year terms, with one third of the members retiring every two years. Bihar legislature assembly has 243 seats. For the election of its members, the state is divided into 243 Assembly Constituencies in which the candidate securing the largest number of votes is declared elected. In the 2010 Bihar Legislative Assembly election, the National Democratic Alliance formed the state government having secured a simple majority of 206 seats.[1] Bihar Legislative Assembly came into existence in 1937. The Assembly had a strength of 152 members. According to the provisions of the Constitution of India, the first General Elections in the state were held in 1952. The total strength of membership in the Assembly was 331, including one nominated member. Dr Sri Krishna Singh became the first Leader of the house and the Chief Minister and Dr Anurag Narayan Sinha was elected the first deputy leader of the assembly and became state's first Deputy Chief Minister. It was reduced to 318 during the second General Elections. In 1977, the total number of elected members of the Bihar Legislative Assembly was further raised from 318 to 324. With the creation of a separate State of Jharkhand, by an Act of Parliament titled the Bihar Reorganisation Act, 2000, the strength of the Bihar Legislative Assembly was reduced from 325 to 243 members. The current Nitish Kumar government is a minority, powered by the BJP and LJP to majority status The upper house known as the Legislative Council has lesser powers than the Assembly and several of its members are nominated by the Assembly. Others are elected from various sections of the society like Graduates and Teachers. Currently the Legislative Council consists of 95 members. A new Province of Bihar and Orissa was created by the British Government on 12 December 1911. The Legislative Council with a total of 43 members belonging to different categories was formed in 1912. The first sitting of the council was convened on 20 January 1913. In 1936, Bihar attained its separate Statehood. Under the Government of India Act, 1919, the unicameral legislature got converted into bicameral one, i.e. the Bihar Legislative Council and the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Under the Government of India Act, 1935, the Bihar Legislative Council consisted of 29 members. After the first General Elections 1952, the number of members was increased up to 72 and by 1958 the number was raised to 96. With the creation of Jharkhand, as a result of the Bihar Reorganisation Act, 2000 passed by the Parliament, the strength of the Bihar Legislative Council has been reduced from 96 to 75 members In June 2025, Bihar become the first state in India to implement mobile phone-based e-voting in municipal bypolls and elections in six Nagar Panchayats in districts such as Patna, Rohtas, Buxar, and East Champaran.[2][3][4] The facility, introduced by the Bihar State Election Commission with the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), was made available to eligible pregnant women, senior citizens, migrant workers and persons with disabilities.[5][6] Voters could cast their votes from home using the E-SECBHR app.[7] The system used security measures including blockchain encryption, facial recognition, voter ID verification, and device restrictions.[7] According to officials, 70.20% of registered voters used the mobile e-voting system, compared to a turnout of 54.6% at traditional polling booths.[8] The first e-vote in Indian electoral history was cast by Bibha Kumari of Pakridayal, East Champaran.[9] Araria · Arrah · Aurangabad · Banka · Begusarai · Bhagalpur · Buxar · Darbhanga · Gaya · Gopalganj · Hajipur · Jahanabad · Jamui · Jhanjharpur · Karakat · Katihar · Khagaria · Kishanganj · Madhepura · Madhubani · Maharajganj · Munger · Muzaffarpur · Nalanda · Nawada · Paschim Champaran · Pataliputra · Patna Sahib · Purnia · Purvi Champaran · Samastipur · Saran · Sasaram · Sheohar · Sitamarhi · Siwan · Supaul · Ujiarpur · Vaishali · Valmiki Nagar 1989-1999 Total Seats- 54 Total Seats- 40 The Election Commission's Model Code of Conduct enters into force as soon as the notification for polls is issued. This places restrictions on the campaigning by political parties as well as prohibits certain government actions that would unduly influence the election. The electoral process in Bihar follows the national model, with Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used for all Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. In 2025, however, the state has also piloted mobile phone–based voting in selected municipal elections.[13][14] After the election day, the EVMs are stood stored in a strong room under heavy security. After the different phases of the elections are complete, a day is set to count the votes. The votes are tallied and typically, the verdict is known within hours. The candidate who has mustered the most votes is declared the winner of the constituency. The party or coalition that has won the most seats is invited by the Governor to form the new government. The coalition or party must prove its majority in the floor of the house (Legislative Assembly) in a vote of confidence by obtaining a simple majority (minimum 50%) of the votes in the House. For few cities in Bihar, the voter registration forms can be generated online and submitted to the nearest electoral office. As of now, India does not have an absentee ballot system. Section 19 of The Representation of the People Act (RPA)-1950[15] allows a person to register to vote if he or she is above 18 years of age and is an ‘ordinary resident’ of the residing constituency i.e. living at the current address for 6 months or longer. Section 20 of the above Act disqualifies a non-resident Indian (NRI) from getting his/her name registered in the electoral rolls. Consequently, it also prevents an NRI from casting his/her vote in elections to the Parliament and to the State Legislatures. The Representation of the People (Amendment) 2006 Bill was introduced in the Parliament by Shri Hanraj Bharadwaj, Minister of Law and Justice during February 2006 with an objective to amend Section 20 of the RPA-1950 to enable NRIs to vote. Despite the report submitted by the Parliamentary Standing Committee two years ago, the Government has so far failed to act on the recommendations. The Bill was reintroduced in the 2008 budget session of the Parliament to the Lok Sabha. But no action taken once again. Several civic society organizations have urged the government to amend the RPA act to allow NRI's and people on the move to cast their vote through absentee ballot system.[16][17] Main Text: Toggle the table of contents Elections in Bihar 3 languages हिन्दीతెలుగుاردو Edit links ArticleTalk English ReadEditView history Tools Tools move to sidebar hide Actions ReadEditView history General What links hereRelated changesUpload filePermanent linkPage informationCite this pageGet shortened URLDownload QR code Print/export Download as PDFPrintable version In other projects Wikimedia CommonsWikidata item Appearance move to sidebar hide From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Overview of the procedure of elections in the Indian state of Bihar Politics of Bihar State Government Constitution Legislature Legislative Assembly Member in Assembly - 243 Legislative Council Member in Council - 95 Executives President Chief Minister Deputy Chief Minister Cabinet Judiciary High Court Chief Justice District Courts Panchayat Elections General elections Assembly elections Political Parties Bharatiya Janata Party Bahujan Samaj Party Communist Party of India Communist Party of India (Marxist) Indian National Congress Janata Dal (United) Nationalist Congress Party Rashtriya Janata Dal Samajwadi Party Subdivisions Division - 9 Districts - 38 Sub-Divisions of Bihar - 101 Towns of Bihar - 130 Blocks in Bihar - 534 Panchayats in Bihar - 8,471 Villages in Bihar - 45,103 Other countries vte This article is part of a series onBihar Governance Governors Chief Ministers Legislative Assembly Political parties High Court Police Topics Arts Cinema Cuisine Culture Wedding Religion Economy Demographics Education Elections Festivals Flora and fauna Geography Outline History Historic sites Timeline of Bihar Maurya Empire Language List Script Literature Grammar People Tribes Dance Music Media Painting Politics Sports Tourism Monuments National State Districts Divisions Araria Arwal Aurangabad Banka Begusarai Bhagalpur Bhojpur Buxar Darbhanga East Champaran Gaya Gopalganj Jamui Jehanabad Khagaria Kishanganj Kaimur Katihar Lakhisarai Madhubani Munger Madhepura Muzaffarpur Nalanda Nawada Patna Purnia Rohtas Saharsa Samastipur Sheohar Sheikhpura Saran Sitamarhi Supaul Siwan Vaishali West Champaran GI Products Madhubani paintings Khatwa Sujini embroidery Sikki grass craft Bhagalpur silk Bhagalpuri zardalu Katarni rice Magahi Paan Shahi lychee Silao Khaja Manjusha Art Mithila Makhana Marcha rice India portalvte Elections in the state of Bihar, India are conducted in accordance with the Constitution of India.

Bihar electoral system[edit] The elections to the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly are conducted along similar lines with the major difference being size of constituencies. At present each Lok Sabha constituency consists of 6 Legislative Assembly constituency. Each constituency elects a single member to represent them via a First Past the Post System, where a candidate with plurality of total votes cast is elected. Currently the major parties in the state are Bharatiya Janata Party, Indian National Congress, Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Rashtriya Lok Morcha and Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party. The state was dominated by Indian National Congress until the decade of 1970s with parties like BJP and Janata Dal gaining prominence. For the purpose of elections every party is assigned a symbol to help voters in recognizing the candidate they support. National level representation[edit] Lok Sabha delegation[edit] Further information: 2009 Indian general election in Bihar Currently, the state of Bihar sends 40 representatives to the Lok Sabha, elected through a first past the post system. The Indian general election, 2009 in Bihar were held for 40 seats with the state going to polls in the first four phases of the general elections. The major contenders in the state were the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Indian National Congress and the Fourth Front. NDA consisted of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (United) whereas the fourth front was constituted of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Lok Jan Shakti Party (LJP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP). Rajya Sabha delegation[edit] Both the houses of the state legislature jointly nominate Members of Parliament to the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha or Council of States is the upper house of the Parliament of India. Membership of Rajya Sabha is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of 250 members, and current laws have provision for 245 members. Most of the members of the House are indirectly elected by state and territorial legislatures using single transferable votes, while the President of India can appoint 12 members for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. Members sit for staggered six-year terms, with one third of the members retiring every two years. State level representation[edit] Legislative assembly[edit] Main article: Bihar Legislative Assembly Bihar legislature assembly has 243 seats. For the election of its members, the state is divided into 243 Assembly Constituencies in which the candidate securing the largest number of votes is declared elected. In the 2010 Bihar Legislative Assembly election, the National Democratic Alliance formed the state government having secured a simple majority of 206 seats.[1] Bihar Legislative Assembly came into existence in 1937. The Assembly had a strength of 152 members. According to the provisions of the Constitution of India, the first General Elections in the state were held in 1952. The total strength of membership in the Assembly was 331, including one nominated member. Dr Sri Krishna Singh became the first Leader of the house and the Chief Minister and Dr Anurag Narayan Sinha was elected the first deputy leader of the assembly and became state's first Deputy Chief Minister. It was reduced to 318 during the second General Elections. In 1977, the total number of elected members of the Bihar Legislative Assembly was further raised from 318 to 324. With the creation of a separate State of Jharkhand, by an Act of Parliament titled the Bihar Reorganisation Act, 2000, the strength of the Bihar Legislative Assembly was reduced from 325 to 243 members. The current Nitish Kumar government is a minority, powered by the BJP and LJP to majority status Legislative Council[edit] Main article: Bihar Legislative Council The upper house known as the Legislative Council has lesser powers than the Assembly and several of its members are nominated by the Assembly. Others are elected from various sections of the society like Graduates and Teachers. Currently the Legislative Council consists of 95 members. A new Province of Bihar and Orissa was created by the British Government on 12 December 1911. The Legislative Council with a total of 43 members belonging to different categories was formed in 1912. The first sitting of the council was convened on 20 January 1913. In 1936, Bihar attained its separate Statehood. Under the Government of India Act, 1919, the unicameral legislature got converted into bicameral one, i.e. the Bihar Legislative Council and the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Under the Government of India Act, 1935, the Bihar Legislative Council consisted of 29 members. After the first General Elections 1952, the number of members was increased up to 72 and by 1958 the number was raised to 96. With the creation of Jharkhand, as a result of the Bihar Reorganisation Act, 2000 passed by the Parliament, the strength of the Bihar Legislative Council has been reduced from 96 to 75 members History of elections in Bihar[edit] Assembly election[edit] Year Election Party-wise Details Chief Minister Party 1952 First Assembly Total: 276.

This places restrictions on the campaigning by political parties as well as prohibits certain government actions that would unduly influence the election. Voting day[edit] The electoral process in Bihar follows the national model, with Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used for all Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. In 2025, however, the state has also piloted mobile phone–based voting in selected municipal elections.[13][14] Post elections[edit] After the election day, the EVMs are stood stored in a strong room under heavy security. After the different phases of the elections are complete, a day is set to count the votes. The votes are tallied and typically, the verdict is known within hours. The candidate who has mustered the most votes is declared the winner of the constituency. The party or coalition that has won the most seats is invited by the Governor to form the new government. The coalition or party must prove its majority in the floor of the house (Legislative Assembly) in a vote of confidence by obtaining a simple majority (minimum 50%) of the votes in the House. Voter registration[edit] For few cities in Bihar, the voter registration forms can be generated online and submitted to the nearest electoral office. Absentee voting[edit] As of now, India does not have an absentee ballot system. Section 19 of The Representation of the People Act (RPA)-1950[15] allows a person to register to vote if he or she is above 18 years of age and is an ‘ordinary resident’ of the residing constituency i.e. living at the current address for 6 months or longer. Section 20 of the above Act disqualifies a non-resident Indian (NRI) from getting his/her name registered in the electoral rolls. Consequently, it also prevents an NRI from casting his/her vote in elections to the Parliament and to the State Legislatures. The Representation of the People (Amendment) 2006 Bill was introduced in the Parliament by Shri Hanraj Bharadwaj, Minister of Law and Justice during February 2006 with an objective to amend Section 20 of the RPA-1950 to enable NRIs to vote. Despite the report submitted by the Parliamentary Standing Committee two years ago, the Government has so far failed to act on the recommendations. The Bill was reintroduced in the 2008 budget session of the Parliament to the Lok Sabha. But no action taken once again. Several civic society organizations have urged the government to amend the RPA act to allow NRI's and people on the move to cast their vote through absentee ballot system.[16][17] Further reading[edit] Subrata K.

Winning will require converting undecided voters without alienating your core supporters. Every decision matters.
✅ PROMPT (What You Must Do)
1. Flawless JSON Structure:
Your entire output must be a single, valid JSON object. No commentary, no apologies, no markdown formatting.
The root object must contain name, startNode, and nodes.
Every path from startNode to an isEnding node must consist of exactly five decision points (questions).
You must generate every possible path and its corresponding unique ending. No dead ends. Every nextNode must link to a valid node key.

3. Guidelines for High-Quality Content:
Narrative Arc Guideline: The five questions in any path should follow a logical campaign progression. Structure the branching paths around this arc:
Question 1 (Opening Gambit): A high-level strategic choice about the campaign's core message or target demographic.
Question 2 (Crisis/Opportunity): An unexpected event occurs (a rival's gaffe, a sudden protest, a media scandal). The player must react.
Question 3 (Alliance & Resources): A choice related to managing coalition partners, allocating scarce resources (funds, manpower), or dealing with internal party dissent.
Question 4 (The Big Stage): A decision about a major public-facing event (a televised debate, a massive rally, a controversial interview). This is the climax of the campaign.
Question 5 (The Final Push): A last-minute tactical choice for the final 48 hours before voting (e.g., a targeted social media blitz, a grassroots door-to-door effort, a polarizing statement).
Sophisticated Political Dilemmas: The choices presented must be genuinely difficult and reflect real-world political trade-offs. Avoid simple "good vs. bad" options. Instead, frame choices around concepts like:
Pragmatism vs. Ideology: Compromise on a core issue to win an ally, or stick to your principles and risk isolation?
Short-Term Gain vs. Long-Term Vision: Make a populist promise for immediate votes that could harm the economy later?
Appeasing the Base vs. Broadening Appeal: Double down on a message that excites your core voters but alienates moderates?
4. Ending Node Requirements:
Each ending node must contain text, isEnding: true, a summary, and stats.
Summary (100-200 words): The summary must be a compelling narrative that explicitly connects the player's key decisions throughout their specific path to the final election outcome and the state of their party and Bihar.
Stats Object: The stats must logically reflect the summary. The required four keys are:
publicApproval (string, e.g., "48%")
economicOutlook (string, e.g., "Strong Mandate for Growth" or "Populist Strain")
partyCohesion (string, e.g., "Iron Grip" or "Internal Dissent")
socialFabric (string, e.g., "Deeply Polarized" or "Broadly Harmonious")
Stat Logic Guideline:
A campaign that heavily relies on caste politics should result in a lower socialFabric score.
A campaign that makes huge spending promises might win, but should result in a negative economicOutlook.
Ignoring party rebels to chase a new voter base should lower the partyCohesion stat.
A narrow victory should result in a publicApproval just over the line (e.g., "51%").
❌ ANTI-PROMPT (What You Must NOT Do)
DO NOT give every question with only 2 options; it should be sometimes with 4 options sometimes 2 or sometimes 3, depending on the context of the question 
DO NOT write any text outside of the single JSON object.
DO NOT generate generic or vague questions like "What do you do next?". Each question must present a specific scenario.
DO NOT create purely "golden" or "disastrous" endings. Every victory should have a cost, and every loss should have a lesson.
DO NOT deviate from the required five-question depth for all paths.
DO NOT forget the summary and stats in any ending node.
DO NOT use any keys in the stats object other than the four specified.
